Please state what is black box testing? How about white box testing? You can also give an example.

Black box testing is based on specification and we don't know anything about internal structure.
EXEMPLE: A tester, without knowledge of the internal structures of a website, tests the web pages by using a browser and verifying the outputs against the expected outcome.

White Box Testing is a software testing method in which the internal structure is known to the tester. 
EXEMPLE: unit testing
